I'll use my most powerful attack. Kiro tries to slice him with a laugh, and grazes Shoga's arm and leg. Shoga creates more after images, and they spin around each other in a dome. This attack will be my strongest. Shoga runs fast to create a thunder dome, which Kiro can't escape. Thunder DOME!!!! Kiro just watches around, looking for an exit. Now, all of this thunder. He strikes the ground with the thunder, which creates a lot of pressure and heat in the air. It starts raining. 'Hahahahaha! You missed' says Kiro. It's raining, and Shoga again creates afterimages. That won't work a second time. More metal blasts which hit after images. Shoga is faster than Kiro, and thunder starts attacking. Now's my chance. THUNDER DOMEEEEAAA!!!!!! Again using the same attack? THUNDER DRAGON!!!!!! All of the electricity from the second thunder dome turns into a thunder dragon which bites Kiro, even surpassing his metal armor. Kiro is defeated.
